# Amazfit Sokoban

A **Zepp OS mini app** for Amazfit watches.

This repository currently holds the **engineering foundation** - tooling, linting,
tests, CI and the release pipeline are set up and green. The app itself is built on
top of it.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dchernykh1984/AmazfitSokoban.git
cd AmazfitSokoban
npm install
```

## Develop

```bash
npm test          # run the unit tests (Vitest)
npm run lint      # ESLint
npm run format    # rewrite files with Prettier
npm run preview   # QR-preview on a device via the Zepp app in Developer Mode
npm run build     # produce the .zab store bundle
```

`preview` and `build` fetch the [Zeus CLI](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/guides/quick-start/)
on demand (`npx`), so it is not tracked as a dependency; the first run downloads it.
`@zeppos/zml` is added as a dependency together with the app code.

## Pre-commit hooks (contributors)

```bash
uv tool install pre-commit   # or: pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

After that the hooks run automatically: Prettier and ESLint and a non-ASCII guard on
commit, Conventional Commits validation on the commit message, and the unit tests on
push.

## Continuous integration and releases

Every pull request must pass the required checks: Prettier, ESLint, the unit tests,
`actionlint`, commitizen (Conventional Commits), and an OSV dependency scan.

Releases are automated with `release-please`: it maintains a version-bump PR from the
Conventional Commits and, when merged, tags a GitHub Release. The release build
workflow then produces the `.zab` store bundle and attaches it. Uploading the `.zab`
to the Zepp App Store stays manual, because Zepp has no public publish API.
